I build software and tools that are automatable, reproducible, and measurable. 🧰  
Most of my projects are pipelines: ingestion → processing → checks → publish/output. ⚙️

### What I build 🧩
- Full‑stack TypeScript/Node apps (Next.js) with a real data layer (Prisma/Postgres) and scheduled jobs. 🕒
- Electron desktop tools with actual UI complexity (panels, drag/resize, media control), not “a website in a window”. 🖥️
- Data-driven sites (Next.js/Astro): structured sources (RSS/CSV) → generated pages, SEO-oriented output. 🧾🔍
- Small, sharp utilities: a Chrome extension that turns highlights into flashcards, and a productized Notion + Google Sheets template pack with packaging scripts. 🧠📦

### How I build 🧱
- CI is not copy-pasted per repo: reusable GitHub Actions workflows + quality gates (lint/test/build/security). ✅
- One-command environments: Docker/Compose, with Windows + WSL in mind and cross-platform scripts (Bash + PowerShell). 🐳🪟
- Testing where it matters: Python pytest-based API smoke/contract suites with reporting, plus e2e-style checks in web apps when needed. 🧪
- Observability/alerting lab (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki) to practice alerts and incident drills in a reproducible setup. 📈🚨

### AI, but treated as a dependency 🤖
- Optional component, controlled inputs/outputs, deterministic fallback when AI is not available.
- If it can’t be automated and reproduced, it’s not done. 🔁
